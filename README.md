# RGB-Theme-For-Powercord
A theme I made for PowerCord, it can also be used for BD(Better Discord)
Some of this code was forked from https://github.com/Fahrenheit/Discord-RGB-Snippet-WIP. Check out his github profile N0tEto/Discord-RGB-Snippet-WIP.
Sorry if I don't know how to give proper creditsðŸ˜“
