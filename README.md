# RGB-Theme-For-Powercord
A theme I made for PowerCord, it can also be used for BD(Better Discord)
Some of this code was forked from https://github.com/Fahrenheit/Discord-RGB-Snippet-WIP. Check out his github profile N0tEto/Discord-RGB-Snippet-WIP.
Sorry if I don't know how to give proper creditsðŸ˜“

To add this theme to powercord, open the powercord themes folder and type "cmd" in the search. It'll open a command prompt. Type or paste ```git clone https://github.com/N0tEto/RGB-Theme-For-Powercord``` into the terminal, hit enter and refresh your powercord. Done.

To add this theme to betterdiscord, download the .css file and open your betterdiscord themes folder. Drag the file into it and you're done.

The theme looks something like this lol. I don't recommend using this theme if you're on a low end computer. The RGB can affect performance.
